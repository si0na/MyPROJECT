Breast Cancer Detection
This project is a breast cancer detection tool built with a backend model developed in Google Colab and a frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The model uses machine learning to analyze data and predict breast cancer, providing an accessible way to perform preliminary checks.

Project Overview
Backend: Developed using a machine learning model in Google Colab.
Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Objective: To create an interactive and user-friendly application for detecting breast cancer using predictive analytics.
Features
User Authentication: Login page for secure access.
Detection Interface: A main page where users can input data for breast cancer prediction.
Real-time Processing: The backend model processes data and returns predictions quickly.
Project Structure
Backend (Google Colab): The model training and prediction logic were developed using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas.
Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript): The user interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, with a streamlined workflow.
How to Run the Project
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/si0na/MyPROJECT/
Setup Backend in Google Colab:

Open the Colab notebook in the backend folder.
Ensure you have uploaded the necessary dataset and dependencies.
Run each cell to train and initialize the model.
Use a library like Flask to create an API endpoint and link it to your frontend.
Setup Frontend:

Open the login.html file in the html folder.
Connect the frontend to the backend endpoint created in Colab.
Use a local server or deploy to see the results.
Usage
Login: Access the application by logging in.
Enter Data: Navigate to the detection page and enter the required medical data.
Get Prediction: Submit the form to receive the breast cancer prediction from the backend model.
Technologies Used
Backend: Google Colab, Python, Flask, scikit-learn
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Future Enhancements
Add more layers to the model to increase accuracy.
Improve the user interface for enhanced accessibility.
Deploy on a cloud platform to make it more widely accessible.
